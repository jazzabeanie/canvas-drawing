# Canvas Drawing

Some of my own play, and lessons from the creative coding domestika course.

# Setup

Run `npm install`

# Usage

The `html` files can simply be opened in the browser.

`js` files are best run by the package `canvas-sketch`. Read about it here: https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch.

Basic usage is to run `npx canvas-sketch-cli FILENAME`.
